    "\n",
    "The **Location** field can be formatted in three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Field** (City / Country):\n",
    "   - For locations like `Jakarta metropolitan area`, `Greater Jakarta`, or `Greater Semarang`, the location contains only the city and country.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example: \n",
    "   - `Jakarta metropolitan area` --> [City: Jakarta, Country: Indonesia]\n",
    "   - `Greater Jakarta` --> [City: Jakarta, Country: Indonesia]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two Fields** (Province, Country):\n",
    "   - For locations like `Bali, Indonesia`, the location contains the province and country.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   - `Bali, Indonesia` --> [Province: Bali, Country: Indonesia]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Three Fields** (City, Province, Country):\n",
    "   - For locations like `Badung, Bali, Indonesia`, the location contains the city, province, and country.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   - `Badung, Bali, Indonesia` --> [City: Badung, Province: Bali, Country: Indonesia]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process to Split Location\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to split the **Location** field will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the location contains **one field** (city or province), we will assume the format to be `[City], [Country]`.\n",
    "- If the location contains **two fields** (province and country), we will split the fields into `[Province], [Country]`.\n",
    "- If the location contains **three fields** (city, province, and country), we will split the fields into `[City], [Province], [Country]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify how many parts the location contains by counting commas.\n",
    "2. Split the location accordingly:\n",
    "   - If there is **one part**, assign it to the **City** and assume the country is `Indonesia`.\n",
    "   - If there are **two parts**, assign them to **Province** and **Country**.\n",
    "   - If there are **three parts**, assign them to **City**, **Province**, and **Country**.\n",
    "   \n",

    "### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- When **Level** contains values such as `Full-time`, `Part-time`, `Internship`, `Temporary`, or `Contract`, these values are actually meant for the **Type** field.\n",
    "- We can safely assume that for such cases, the job does not have a Seniority Level listed, and the value can be shifted back into the **Type** field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Field Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Level**: The seniority level expected for a job, such as:\n",
    "  - `Entry-level`\n",
    "  - `Mid-to-Senior Level`\n",
    "  - `Associate`\n",
    "  - `Director`\n",
    "  - `Executive`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Type**: The employment type of the job, such as:\n",
    "  - `Full-time`\n",
    "  - `Part-time`\n",
    "  - `Internship`\n",
    "  - `Temporary`\n",
    "  - `Contract`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Function**: The department or job function this role falls into (e.g., `Engineering`, `Marketing`).\n",
    "- **Industry**: The field of the company in general (e.g., `Technology`, `Healthcare`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Misplaced Data**:\n",
    "   - Look for rows where the **Level** field contains values that belong to the **Type** field (`Full-time`, `Part-time`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correct the Fields**:\n",
    "   - Shift the content from **Level** to **Type** for these rows.\n",
    "   - Set the **Level** field to `None` or `NaN` to indicate that the seniority level is not provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validate the Data**:\n",
    "   - Ensure that the content in **Level** aligns with seniority levels.\n",
    "   - Verify that the content in **Type** corresponds to employment types.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update the Dataset**:\n",
    "   - Save the corrected dataset for further analysis.\n",
